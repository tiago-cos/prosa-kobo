    # Overview

    Prosa-Kobo is a middleware layer that translates requests from a Kobo device into Prosa requests and responses from Prosa into Kobo-compatible responses. With it, you can connect any Kobo device to your Prosa backend.

    # How it Works

    Each Kobo device that contacts the middleware can be associated with a Prosa API key.  
    When a device is linked to an API key, all of its requests are translated into Prosa API calls, and the responses are converted back into Kobo-compatible responses before being returned to the device.  

    This middleware **completely replaces the official Kobo backend**, no requests are proxied to Kobo’s original servers.

    # Configuration

    Prosa-Kobo can be configured in two ways:

    1. **Configuration files (TOML)**
    2. **Environment variables**

    The configuration system is layered, meaning defaults are loaded first and then overridden by local configuration or environment variables.

    ## Default Configuration

    Prosa-Kobo ships with a default configuration file located at `src/config/default.toml`.

    This file is always loaded when the program starts.  
    You can change the path where Prosa-Kobo looks for the default configuration by setting the `DEFAULT_CONFIGURATION` environment variable. If not specified, it defaults to `src/config/default.toml`.

    ### Example `default.toml`

    ```toml
    [server.bind]
    host = "0.0.0.0"
    port = 5001

    # Uncomment if behind a proxy

    # [server.public]
    # scheme = "http"
    # host = "192.168.0.1"
    # port = 5001

    [database]
    file_path = "persistence/database.db"

    [auth]
    secret_key = "secret_key"
    token_duration = 900
    refresh_token_duration = 3600

    [prosa]
    scheme = "http"
    host = "127.0.0.1"
    port = 5000

    [download_token]
    book_expiration = 60
    ```

    ## Local Configuration

    Any value from the default configuration can be overridden by creating a local configuration file.

    By default, Prosa-Kobo looks for `src/config/local.toml`.

    You can change this path using the `LOCAL_CONFIGURATION` environment variable.  
    Values defined in `local.toml` will take precedence over `default.toml`.

    ## Environment Variables

    All configuration values can also be controlled directly through environment variables.  
    The format is `<SECTION>__<KEY>`.

    -   Sections map to the `[section]` headers in the TOML file.
        
    -   Keys map to the field names inside each section.

    **Important:**

    - Sections and keys are separated using **double underscores (`__`)**.
        
    - Single underscores (`_`) inside a key name (e.g. `secret_key`) remain as-is and **are not separators**.
        
    For example:

    - To set the server port (`[server.bind].port`):
        
      ```bash
      export SERVER__BIND__PORT=8080
      ```

    - To set the jwt key (`[auth].secret_key`):  
      _(notice there is only **one underscore** between `SECRET` and `KEY` because the field name itself has an underscore)_
        
      ```bash
      export AUTH__SECRET_KEY=super_secret_key
      ```

    ## Configuration Reference

    -   **[server.bind]**
    
        -   `host`: Network interface where the middleware server will listen.
            
        -   `port`: Port number the middleware server will listen on.
        
    -   **[server.public]** _(required if running behind a proxy)_
        
        -   `scheme`: Scheme (`http` or `https`) used when generating URLs returned to clients.
            
        -   `host`: Public hostname or IP address clients use to reach the middleware.
            
        -   `port`: Public port number clients use to reach the middleware.
            
        These settings are necessary when the middleware is running behind a proxy, because the real client-facing address cannot be detected automatically.  
        If the middleware is not behind a proxy, this section can be omitted, and values will be detected automatically.

    -   **[database]**
        
        -   `file_path`: Path to the SQLite database file.

    -   **[auth]**
        
        -   `secret_key`: Secret key used for signing JWT tokens.  
        -   `token_duration`: Expiration duration (seconds) for JWT tokens provided to Kobo devices.  
        -   `refresh_token_duration`: Expiration duration (seconds) for refresh tokens provided to Kobo devices.

    -   **[prosa]**
        
        -   `scheme`: Scheme (`http` or `https`) used to connect to the Prosa backend.  
        -   `host`: Hostname or IP address of the Prosa server.  
        -   `port`: Port number of the Prosa server.

    -   **[download_token]**
        
        -   `book_expiration`: Duration (seconds) of the validity of download tokens for books.  
          
            Kobo devices cannot use JWT authentication for book downloads, so the middleware generates temporary download tokens that authenticate devices for retrieving books.

    ## Logging

    You can control the logging level using the standard `RUST_LOG` environment variable.  
    Supported values include `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`, and `trace`.

    - Default:
      ```bash
      RUST_LOG=info
      ```
        
    - Example (set log level to warn):
      ```bash
      export RUST_LOG=warn
      ```

    # Installation & Setup

    Prosa-Kobo can be run either as a **Docker container (recommended)** or as a standalone **binary**.

    ## Docker Container (Recommended)

    The simplest way to get Prosa-Kobo running alongside Prosa is using Docker. Below is an example `compose.yaml` configuration that runs both services together:

    ```yaml
    services:
      prosa-kobo:
        image: tsousa28/prosa-kobo
        container_name: prosa-kobo
        ports:
          - "5001:5001"
        environment:
          - AUTH__SECRET_KEY=very_secret_key
          - PROSA__HOST=prosa
          - PROSA__PORT=5000
        volumes:
          - prosa_kobo:/app/persistence
        restart: unless-stopped

      prosa:
        image: tsousa28/prosa
        container_name: prosa
        ports:
          - "5000:5000"
        environment:
          - AUTH__ADMIN_KEY=very_secret_key
          - AUTH__SECRET_KEY=another_very_secret_key
        volumes:
          - prosa_library:/app/library
        restart: unless-stopped

    volumes:
      prosa_kobo:
      prosa_library:  
    ```

    This will start both Prosa and Prosa-Kobo, making Prosa available on port `5000` and Prosa-Kobo on port `5001`.  
    Kobo devices should connect to port `5001` for all requests.

    **Important notes:**

    -   Change all secret keys (`AUTH__SECRET_KEY` for Prosa-Kobo and both `AUTH__ADMIN_KEY` and `AUTH__SECRET_KEY` for Prosa) to secure values before using the services.
        
    -   Persistence requires **named volumes** mounted at `/app/persistence` for Prosa-Kobo and `/app/library` for Prosa. Bind mounts are currently not supported due to permission issues in rootless containers.
        
    -   Environment variables that change internal paths are ignored in these container images.
        
    ## Binary

    If you prefer running Prosa-Kobo as a binary:

    1.  **Set up Prosa**  
        Make sure Prosa is installed and running. You can follow the official guide: [Prosa Installation and Setup](https://tiago-cos.github.io/prosa/#section/Installation-and-Setup).

    2.  **Configure Prosa-Kobo**  
        Adjust the Prosa-Kobo configuration file as needed. For full details, see the [Configuration Reference](https://tiago-cos.github.io/prosa-kobo/#section/Configuration/Configuration-Reference).

    3.  **Run the Middleware**  
        Launch the Prosa-Kobo binary. Kobo devices should now connect to the middleware, which will handle requests and translate them to and from Prosa.

    ## Next Steps

    1.  **Point Your Kobo Device to Prosa-Kobo**  
        On your Kobo device, edit the `.kobo/Kobo/Kobo eReader.conf` file and change the `api_endpoint` value to the Prosa-Kobo server’s host.

    2.  **Attempt a Sync**  
        Try syncing the device. The first attempt will fail since the device is not yet linked.

    3.  **Check for Unlinked Devices**  
        Retrieve the device ID using the [List Unlinked Devices](https://tiago-cos.github.io/prosa-kobo/#tag/Devices/operation/list_unlinked_devices) endpoint.

    4.  **Link the Device**  
        Link the device to a Prosa API key with the [Link Device](https://tiago-cos.github.io/prosa-kobo/#tag/Devices/operation/link_device) endpoint.

    You’re now ready to sync your Kobo device with Prosa through Prosa-Kobo!
