//TODO here's how annotations work: the kobo devices stores an ETag alongisde each bookId. Before requesting annotations, it sends a request to /api/v3/content/checkforchanges
// with the bookIds and the etag of each book. The response to this request are the bookIds of the books whose annotations have changed (have a different etag than expected).
// After this, the kobo makes a request to /api/v3/content/{book_id}/annotations. This endpoint returns the book annotations and a new etag. The kobo then stores this etag
// alongside the requested bookId, ending the cycle.
// Here's how I'm going to implement this: In prosa, we do it like normal, where each book has an "annotations last changed" timestamp, and if the timestamp is higher
// than the /sync since query parameter, we return that book_id. Can't have a "since" parameter since that would entail recording deletes as well, but the kobo treats the
// response body as _all_ the annotations, meaning I'd need to keep track of all annotations here anyways. Might as well just send everything.
// Then, in this middleware, I'll have an annotations table, where I store a relationship between a book_id, its etag. Then, in the /sync endpoint, we iterate over the
// annotation changed book ids, and we go and change their etag here in the relationship.
// by doing this, when the kobo next checks for changes, the book ids of the books that were affected will be returned. After that, the kobo will get the annotations of
// each book that has had annotations changed and I'll return the changed etag in the headers.

//New things: In the annotation requests from kobo -> server, the kobo only includes added annotations since the last 204 response from the server annotations endpoint.
//If an annotation was deleted between the last 204 response, the kobo will send the annotation id in a deleted array.
